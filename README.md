#Assignment 6: Reinforcement Learning

Use TF-Agents or DQN Agent to train an agent that can successfully land the lunar lander in OpenAI Gymâ€™s LunarLander-v2 environment.

Create a QNetwork or simple DQN epsilon policy network with 4 output neurons (one per possible action).  [TF-agents use Epsilon Greedy Collect policy or  DQN Agents use Epsilon greedy policy]        [15 points] 

   2. Discuss the rationale of the activation functions used in the network. [10 points]
        [TF-agents - QNetwork or DQN agent - Neural network which computes Q values]

   3. Discuss the rationale of the loss function used in the network. [10 points]


   4. Implement a strategy that adjusts the following hyperparameters: (i) the number of iterations, (ii) the         number of episodes, (iii) the maximum number of steps, and (iv) the discount factor  at each step.          [50 points]


   5. Provide the parameters of the worst and best network policy and plot their corresponding Mean reward on the y-axis to Episode on the x-axis. [15 points]
